# Adding Admin User to Local Database

This is required because I have used a local database for this app. In requirements, PostgreSQL is given. When you log in to the app using auth0 default role is client. Only the admin has access to assign roles. You can not go to the admin dashboard. For that, you have to do it manuallyðŸ˜‚.
After cloning the project repository and setting it up locally, you can add an admin user to the local database using the following cURL command:

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/v1/users -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"user": {"name": "Admin", "email": "admin@gmail.com", "pass": "null", "role": "admin"}}'
```

This command will send a POST request to the `/api/v1/users` endpoint with the following JSON payload:


After successful execution, You can Register the user with the `admin@gmail.com` email from the auth0 and after login you will get admin access. Now, In another browser, you can log in using MS identity or Google default role will be a client. You can change it from the admin panel in the add user section.

# Limitation of the Auth0:-
Generally, Auth0 provides an authentication service that handles user authentication and provides your application with authentication tokens. However, I faced an issue that, in the Chrome browser lost the user data after each refresh but the same thing worked well with the Edge browser. So check it in a different browser for the testing.


### Usage:

1. Register for an account or log in using Microsoft credentials.
2. Navigate through different sections of the platform to perform CRUD operations or view project details.
3. Manage user roles and permissions as an Admin.
5. Receive email notifications for updates in the platform.
6. Export project details as a document for offline reference.
