**Customer Success Platform API Configuration README**

Welcome to the README for configuring the API backend of your Customer Success Platform built using Ruby on Rails. This guide will walk you through the necessary steps to set up your development environment, database configuration, and other essential settings.

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Ruby (preferably the latest stable version)
- Ruby on Rails framework
- Database system (such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.)
- Bundler gem (for managing gem dependencies)
- Any additional gems or libraries required for your specific API functionality

### Getting Started

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   Move into the project directory:

   ```
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Use Bundler to install all required gem dependencies:

   ```
   bundle install
   ```

3. **Database Configuration:**
   Certainly! Here's how you can include the `.env` file configuration in your README:


# Setting Up Environment Variables

1. **Create the `.env` File:**
   In the root directory of your Rails project, create a file named `.env`.

2. **Add Database Configuration:**
   Open the `.env` file and add the following lines to configure your PostgreSQL database:

   ```plaintext
   DATABASE_NAME=test
   DATABASE_USERNAME=postgres
   DATABASE_PASSWORD=12345678
   DATABASE_HOST=localhost
   DATABASE_PORT=5432
   ```

   Make sure to replace the values with your actual database credentials and connection details.

3. **Loading Environment Variables:**
   To load these environment variables into your Rails application during development, you can use the `dotenv-rails` gem. Ensure that you have `dotenv-rails` included in your Gemfile and installed in your project.

   ```ruby
   gem 'dotenv-rails', groups: [:development, :test]
   ```


4. **Accessing Environment Variables:**
   Once your `.env` file is set up, you can access these environment variables in your Rails application using `ENV['VARIABLE_NAME']`.

   For example, in your `config/database.yml` file:

   ```yaml
   default: &default
     <<: *default
     database: <%= ENV['DATABASE_NAME'] %>
     username: <%= ENV['DATABASE_USERNAME'] %>
     password: <%= ENV['DATABASE_PASSWORD'] %>
     host: <%= ENV['DATABASE_HOST'] %>
     port: <%= ENV['DATABASE_PORT'] %>
   ```

5. **Database Setup:**
   Run the following command to create the database schema and load the initial schema:

   ```
   rails db:create
   rails db:migrate
   ```

6. **Running the Server:**
   Start the Rails server by running:

   ```
   rails server -p 4000
   ```

   By default, the server will start on `http://localhost:4000`.
