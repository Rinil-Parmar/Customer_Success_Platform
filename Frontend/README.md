**Customer Service Platform Frontend README**

Welcome to the README for the frontend of your Customer Service Platform built with React.js. This guide will provide you with essential information to set up and configure the frontend of your application.

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- Git (for cloning the repository and version control)
- A text editor or IDE of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text)

### Getting Started

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   Move into the project directory:

   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Use npm to install all required dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server:**
   Start the development server to run your React application:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   This command will start the development server and open your application in a web browser. By default, the development server runs on `http://localhost:3000`.
